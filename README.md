## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

![button](https://github.com/Choi-JaeHyeok-21500749/11053/blob/main/11053_pro.JPG)

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I notice that greedy algorithm will not work.
I see that the number of N is not that big (1000), so using more time complexity will not make a problem.
I solve it with O(N^2), but I think there will be more faster way to solve this problem.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
Thank you for visiting this github!
